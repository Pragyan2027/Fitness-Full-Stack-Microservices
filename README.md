# 🏋️ Fitness Full Stack Microservices Project

A **modern fitness platform** built on a **microservices architecture** leveraging Java Spring Boot, React, Kafka, OAuth2, and cutting-edge AI integrations.  
This system is designed for scalability, security, and modularity — enabling smooth communication between services through Kafka and centralized access through a Gateway.

## 🧩 Microservices Description

| Service Name          | Description                                                                 | Tech Used                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🏃 **Activity Service**      | Manages workout activities, progress tracking, and exercise logs.              | Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL          |
| 🥗 **Nutrition Service**     | Handles meal plans, calorie tracking, and nutrition data.                       | Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL          |
| 👤 **User Service**          | Manages user registration, profiles, and authentication.                        | Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL          |
| 🧠 **AI Service**            | Uses **Spring AI** for personalized recommendations & activity predictions.    | Spring Boot, Spring AI, MongoDB         |
| ⚙️ **Config Server**        | Provides centralized configuration for all microservices.                       | Spring Cloud Config                    |
| 🧭 **Eureka Server**        | Enables service discovery and load balancing.                                   | Spring Cloud Eureka                    |
| 🌉 **API Gateway**          | Central entry point for all microservices with security & routing.              | Spring Cloud Gateway, OAuth2           |

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

- Implemented **OAuth 2.0** with JWT tokens for secure access.
- Gateway routes all requests and verifies tokens.
- Role-based access control ensures proper authorization for each service.

---

## 📡 Communication Flow

- **Synchronous**: Gateway → Service via REST.
- **Asynchronous**: Services communicate with each other using **Apache Kafka** event streams for better decoupling and scalability.
- **Centralized Config**: All services pull configuration from a Config Server.
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka handles service registration and discovery.
