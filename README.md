#  Fitness Full Stack Microservices Project

A **modern fitness platform** built on a **microservices architecture** leveraging Java Spring Boot, React, Kafka, OAuth2, and cutting-edge AI integrations.  
This system is designed for scalability, security, and modularity — enabling smooth communication between services through Kafka and centralized access through a Gateway.

##  Microservices Description

| Service Name          | Description                                                                 | Tech Used                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|  **Activity Service**      | Manages workout activities, progress tracking, and exercise logs.              | Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL          |
|  **Nutrition Service**     | Handles meal plans, calorie tracking, and nutrition data.                       | Spring Boot, Kafka,Spring AI, MongoDB          |
|  **User Service**          | Manages user registration, profiles, and authentication.                        | Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL          |
|  **AI Service**            | Uses **Spring AI** for personalized recommendations & activity predictions.    | Spring Boot, Spring AI, MongoDB         |
|  **Config Server**        | Provides centralized configuration for all microservices.                       | Spring Cloud Config                    |
|  **Eureka Server**        | Enables service discovery and load balancing.                                   | Spring Cloud Eureka                    |
|  **API Gateway**          | Central entry point for all microservices with security & routing.              | Spring Cloud Gateway, OAuth2           |

##  Security & Authentication

- Implemented **OAuth 2.0** with JWT tokens for secure access.
- Gateway routes all requests and verifies tokens.
- Role-based access control ensures proper authorization for each service.

---

##  Communication Flow

- **Synchronous**: Gateway → Service via REST.
- **Asynchronous**: Services communicate with each other using **Apache Kafka** event streams for better decoupling and scalability.
- **Centralized Config**: All services pull configuration from a Config Server.
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka handles service registration and discovery.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fitness-microservices.git
cd fitness-microservices
---
## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 2. Start Infrastructure

Run **Kafka**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**.  
You can also use **Docker Compose** for faster setup and orchestration.

---

### 3. Start Config & Discovery Servers

```bash
cd config-server
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../eureka-server
mvn spring-boot:run
